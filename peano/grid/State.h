     * This operation tells you whether the grid has changed or is about to
     * change in the next iteration. Often, one uses this as guard for a
     * while loop that iterates until the grid doesn't change anymore - in a
     * setup phase typically.
     *
     * The story is slightly different if you have a distributed mpi parallel
     * code. Here, it can happen that erase commands don't pass through as
     * this erase would destroy whole workers. In such a case,
     * isGridStationary() is false all the time though the grid doesn't change
     * from traversal to traversal. Though, if there were a join (rebalancing),
     * it would change immediately. Also compare to isGridBalanced() for these
     * cases.
     *
     * Another issue arises if you have a grid construction running in
     * parallel. Whenever Peano does some rebalancing, it waits for a couple of
     * iterations (at least IterationsInBetweenRebalancing) on the involved
     * ranks before it continues to rebalance. This is to allow the grid to
     * recover, i.e. to keep all adjacency information up-to-date all the time.
     * It thus can happen that you construct your grid in four iterations and
     * isGridStationary() then returns true as you don't add additional vertices
     * and you do not remove either. Throughout the construction only one fork
     * took place at the very beginning. You now switch to another adapter or
     * you do something else and suddenly the rebalancing kicks in again though
     * you thought everything worked fine.
     *
     * In parallel, it is does either a good idea to use isGridBalanced() or,
     * even more precise, to combine both operations.
     *
     * !!! isGridBalanced()
     *
     * In the parallel case, isGridBalanced() returns true even though an erase
     * is triggered that cannot pass due to the domain decomposition. However,
     * it returns true if and only if the last traversal could have triggered
     * a rebalancing but didn't do so (see isInvolvedInJoinOrFork()).
