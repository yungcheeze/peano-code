     * data from its master:
     *
     * - load balancing information that is directly forwarded to the load
     *   balancing's oracle, and

     * - it is the only node that holds valid data (though it is replicated on the master), and
     * - its content is copied to the master after each iteration.

     * - the node is not joining, and
     * - the node has not just forked.
     *
     * You may not call this operation is _state.reduceDataToMaster() does not hold.
     *
     * For the rationale for the latter constraint, please see Node::updateCellsParallelStateBeforeStore()
     *
     * !!! Send protocol
     *
     * If the SendMasterWorkerAndWorkerMasterMessagesBlocking is set, the code
     * sends its data blocking. It is typical among the most critical
     * communication routines. Thus, switching to a blocking send here is of
     * value as any overhead elimination here pays off.
     *
     * !!! Optimisation
     *
     * In an optimal world where reductions are on, we should send the state to
     * the master when the worker has completed its whole traversal including the
     * halo. The latter fact is the problem: the additional halo cells slow down
     * the overall parallel efficiency. In the latter case, it is also convenient
     * to make the grid invoke the reduction as it is also responsible for the
     * counterpart operation, i.e. the state receive. Anyway, the state is the
     * last thing sent up to the master after all the vertices and the cell data.
     *
     * Sometimes, 100% accurate statistics are not necessary but it is speed that
     * matters though reductions cannot be switched off completely. In this case,
     * it does make sense to send up the state information right after the worker
     * has finished the traversal of its interior cells. But before it runs through
     * all the remaining halo cells. This can be controlled by the optimisation
     * flag. In the end, this operation has to be called at most once either right
     * in by Root::sendCellAndVerticesToMaster() or by the Grid itself.
