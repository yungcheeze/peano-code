/**
 * Load Vertices on Regular Refined Subtree
 *
 * This operation loads vertices into the regular grid container. It may run
 * in parallel to the load cell task and the events (see RegularRefined).
 *
 *
 * !!! Runtime Behaviour if Load Process Does Not Fork Again
 *
 * In the standard spacetree, I may not load the vertices in parallel to the
 * cells, as I need the cell data to know where to load the vertices from.
 * However, I do not need the whole vertices but only the traversal order and
 * the odd/even flags, so what I do is: I create these data on-the-fly in the
 * load-vertex operation once more. This implementation variant yields four
 * different possible realisations. We can parallelise and we can decide
 * whether to create the cell data for the vertex load process on-the-fly or
 * to take this data from cells loaded before. The four variants come along
 * with different runtime characteristics (four cores):
 *
||                                        || parallel || serial
|| read loaded cells from grid container  |      311  |  214s
|| regenerate cell information on-the-fly |      296  |  224s
 *
 * Obviously, it is important to regenerate the cells on-the-fly if we run
 * the load vertices and load cells process in parallel (the parallel version
 * here is slower than the serial one; a fact discussed below). It is, in
 * contrast, important to use the already loaded cells if we run the code
 * serially.

     * traversals going on, before we can fork any tree. Then, the first forks
     * are done on rather fine levels and not on the coarsest levels.

     * I thus decided to handle the first level of the tree separately. If this
     * one may be forked, i.e. if any forks shall happen at all, I open a stack
     * view on the root process, fork this central element of the @f$ 3^d @f$
