     *
     * The create-new-vertex operation can do an immediate refinement, i.e. it
     * can switch a vertex with refinement-triggered into a refining vertex
     * immediately. This way, we can create whole grids in one pass instead of
     * running through the grid for each additional level. However, if the
     * vertex belongs to the parallel boundary, we may not create the new
     * levels immediately. If we did, it might happen that one node refines
     * immediately as it decides only locally to fine, and then the grids are
     * inconsistent. So, for these nodes, we do not update immediately but wait
     * one iteration: Only one level per traversal is refined along parallel
     * boundaries. This way, we ensure that grids along parallel boundaries are
     * consistent.
