/**
 * Heap Singleton - Single Point of Contact for Heap Management
 *
 * HeapData is a template class that manages the storage of
 * vertex data on the heap. The vertex data class has to be generated
 * by DaStGen to provide MPI methods for sending and receiving. The idea of
 * heaps in Peano is that you model your vertex to have one integer index
 * per associated heap object with arbitrary cardinality. Whenever you
 * create a vertex, you ask the heap for a new index and store this index
 * within the vertex. Afterwards, you befill the heap with data.
 *
 * A similar reasoning holds for cells as well.
 *
 * Since a heap is kind of a global thing, this class is a singleton.
 *
 * !!! MPI Handling
 *
 * The elements stored on the heap have to be modeled due to DaStGen. As a
 * result, we can send individual elements as well as sequences of classes
 * away as MPI data types. This is done whenever the user calls send on a
 * specific heap element, i.e. the user calls send with a heap element index
 * and the heap then sends away all elements associated to this heap. This way,
 * the user has full control which heap elements to distribute to which nodes.
 * However, no heap data is exchanged automatically - you have to do this within
 * the mapping's prepare send and merge operations.
 *
 * If an adapter sends or received data, it has first to inform the heap that
 * is will communicate due to MPI. For this, you have to call
 * startToSendOrReceiveHeapData() - typically in beginIteration(). At the end
 * of the iteration, you have to call finishedToSendOrReceiveHeapData().
 *
 * A send operation triggered due to sendData() for a given heap element is
 * a process with three steps. First, the data is copied into a temporary array
 * and meta information is assembled. Then, the meta information is sent away
 * due to a blocking send. Meta data is modeled by
 * \code
\include dastgen/MetaInformation.def
\endcode (see struct MetaInformation). Then, a non-blocking send for the actual
 * data is launched and the send object is pushed on a stack _sendTasks. When
 * one grid traversal terminates, all send processes are finalised. After an
 * iteration, no send operations are dangling anymore, and all data has left
 * the current MPI node.
 *
 * The receive operation is more complex: Peano runs through the spacetree grid
 * forth and back, i.e. the traversal direction of the automaton is inverted
 * after each iteration. As a consequence, we may not simply trigger receive
 * calls when we need data from the heap, as receives in a subsequent traversal
 * have a mirrored order. Instead, the heap has to receive data from a given
 * node in the background until all data has been received. The received data
 * has to be stored in a temporary buffer that we call receive buffer. When all
 * data is available, the read order is the inverse of the receive order, i.e.
 * data from the receive buffer is deployed to the receiving tree automaton in
 * reserve order.
 *
 * To be able to identify whether all data is received, we assume that the
 * number of outgoing messages equals the number of incoming messages. That
 * does however not mean that the cardinalities of the individual messages
 * are the same. We also do not enforce that the data sent in one step is
 * received in the next step. Several additional adapter runs might be
 * triggered before data actually is used due to receiveData() calls. However,
 * we do not support that multiple send traversals may follow each other
 * without receive traversals in-between. The earliest time when you may send
 * heap data again after you've sent out heap data before is the grid traversal
 * where you also receive data.
 *
 * !!! Efficiency note
 *
 * If a lot of heap data is exchanged, the asynchronous exchange of information
 * can block all MPI buffers. In this case, it is useful to call
 * receiveDanglingMessages() from time to time manually within your mappings.
 *
 * !!! Heap data exchange throughout forks, joins, and master-worker exchange
 *
 * The arguing above (with the inversed read order in most cases) does not hold
 * for the forks and joins, and it also does not hold if a master sends heap
 * data to a worker or the other way round. Here, all data is sent-received
 * in-order and synchronous. For these special cases, all communication is
 * deployed to a separate tag to avoid confusion. You switch to this mode due
 * to the synchronous flag of the send and receive operation.
 *
 * !!! Troubleshooting
 *
 * # Is your receiving mapping also calling startToSendOrReceiveHeapData()?
 * # Does each node send exactly the same number of vertices to the other nodes
 *   that it wants to receive? The size of the heap records doesn't have to be
 *   the same but each vertex that wants to receive data also has to send a
 *   (probably empty) record the the corresponding neighbour.
