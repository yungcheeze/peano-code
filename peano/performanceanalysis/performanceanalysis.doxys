/**


 @dir "Performance Analysis"
 
 This directory is kind of a plotter for performance analysis data. It follows few guidelines:
 
 - Logged data is application-specific, i.e. we do not focus on technical details.
 - All passed data is built-in types. Strings are not passed.
 - Watches, string construction, etc. all are used if and only if the corresponding log filters
   are switched off, i.e. if the messages would pass through.
