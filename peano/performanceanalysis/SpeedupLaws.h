/**
 * Class to compute standard speedup laws
 *
 * Currently, I support solely Amdahl's law, i.e. strong speedup.
 *
 * The class is designed to allow users to determine the parameters of
 * Amdahl's law (strong speedup) from multiple measurements. The class
 * requires to be fed with at least two measurements and then determines
 * the serial fraction f of the overall code and the time the code would
 * need to run on a single core.
 *
 * As soon as we have more than two measurements, the problem is obviously
 * overdetermined. Which makes sense, as all measurement data is typically
 * noisy. So we want to construct a model
 *
 * @f$ t(p) = f \cdot t(1) + (1-f) \cdot \frac{t(1)}{p} @f$
 *
 * from measurement tuples @f$ ( p_i, t(p_i) ) @f$.

     * identify the real solution.

While the assembly of the linearised equation as well as the vector $y$ to the
right is ``non-trivial'', the resulting $2\times 2$ system can directly be
solved.
However, we have to keep in mind that this is a linearisation, i.e.~the equation system describes the
inner part of a Newton iteration. We therefore need an additional outer loop
comprising the update rule
