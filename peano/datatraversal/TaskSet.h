/**
 * Task Set
 *
 * This is my very simple wrapper of task parallelism in Peano. The class
 * provides only one type of constructor. This constructor is passed a set of
 * instances representing one functor each. The constructor executes all of
 * them in parallel (if this is the user's wish) and returns. Consequently,
 * this wrapper is the right choice iff all the task are totally independent
 * of each other.
 *
 * No variant ever copies the task: I expect the functors to be handed in as
 * reference. These functors in turn typically are already a copy of the
 * mappings, e.g. So they will be destroyed outside of the task set and merge
 * their state then.
 *
 * !!! Cobra
 *
 * We currently do not support parallel tasks in Cobar, i.e. all the functors
 * are executed one after each other. The reason is that multitasking either
 * result in a seg fault (the constructor with only one argument produces such
 * an error) or a deadlock (the other constructors).
