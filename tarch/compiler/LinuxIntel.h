/**
 * These values are integer values which define which variant of MPI Sends and
 * Receives is actually used. A value smaller than 0 instructs the code to use
 * plain MPI_Recv and MPI_Send, i.e. blocking operation variants. If the value
 * equals 0, the code triggers a logically blocking operation through and
 * ISend or IRecv, respectively, and then enters immediately a loop that tests
 * whether it has completed before the non-blocking handles are released.
 * Within the loop, Peano both realises deadlock detection and it also calls
 *
 * tarch::parallel::Node::getInstance().receiveDanglingMessages();
 *
 * which is the built-in deadlock avoidance which tries to empty all dangling
 * MPI handles whenever possible.
 *
 * If you finally use a value of that is greater than 0, you retain the
 * Isend/Irecv variant with its deadlock/dangling features. Furthermore, the
 * code goes to sleep after each unsuccessful completion test for the specified
 * number of microseconds.
