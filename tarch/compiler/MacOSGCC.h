 * !!! Usage of keyword typename
 * Some compilers (on BlueGene/P, e.g.) require the implementations of templates
 * to use the typename keyword permanenlty. In contrast, they do not allow the
 * header to use typename everywhere. GCC is completely different, i.e. it
 * sometimes complains if there's a typename used in the implementation without
 * the typename keyword in the header. The Intel compiler is less restrictive
 * and accepts both variants.
 *
 * This keyword controls the typename usage. It has to be set on the BlueGene.
 * It has to be commented out if one uses the gcc.
