 * TBB Core for our invasive wrapper.

 * As Peano uses the enqueue routine frequently, our invasive TBB version
 * invades at least one additional core always. That is, you will always see
 * two non-idle ranks. As a consequence, this feature does not support
 * implementations that overbook cores with MPI ranks.
 *
 * Please ensure that isInitialised() or any other routine is called early
 * throughout the user cycle. This implies that the underlying singleton is
 * created.  In Peano, peano::initSharedMemoryEnvironment() does this job.
