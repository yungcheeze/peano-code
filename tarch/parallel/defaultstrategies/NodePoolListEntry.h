/**
 * Node Pool List Entry Storing Status of Node
 *
 * One instance in the whole application has to keep track of the ranks
 * available, which of them are idle, and whether some of them belong to others,
 * i.e. have to communicate a lot/very fast with special other ranks. These
 * relations are represented by a node pool list entry. By this class.
 *
 * In the application's realisation, the node pool does not administer the
 * collection of ranks and their state itself. Instead, it delegates this job to
 * the node pool strategy. This strategy can be adopted to the concrete problem
 * and the concrete hardware, in particular supercomputer topology.
